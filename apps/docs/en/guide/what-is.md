# What is Mafl?

`Mafl` is a very flexible tool for creating your own homepage.
It allows you to create lists of services, categorize and track the performance of certain services.

Ideal for those who have their own home server with a bunch of services.
With `Mafl` you can quickly and easily collect all links in one place.

In addition to the functionality of regular lists, there are dynamic services. They connect to third-party APIs.
They receive the necessary information and display it on the service card. All information is protected.
API requests are hidden from the client in a separate application layer.
