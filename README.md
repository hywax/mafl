## 🚀 Getting started

### Docker

This Docker image is published to both Docker Hub and the GitHub container registry. Depending on your preferences and needs, you can reference both `hywax/mafl` as well as `ghcr.io/hywax/mafl`.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mafl:
    image: hywax/mafl
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - ./config.yml:/app/data/config.yml
```

### Node

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hywax/mafl.git
```

Then install dependencies and build the production bundle (I'm using `yarn` here, you can use `npm` or `pnpm` if you like):

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
```

Finally, run the server:

```shell
yarn preview
```

The application will start with a basic configuration, which is located in the `data` folder.

## 📊 Services

The basic concept of `Mafl` is to create not just a homepage, but to create an interactive homepage page. You can combine different services with each other. You can combine different services to create the perfect customized homepage for you.

List of services:

* **[IP API](https://mafl.hywax.space/services/ip-api.html)** - Shows information about your IP address.
* **[Weather](https://mafl.hywax.space/services/openweathermap.html)** - Shows weather information for your location.

## 🎨 Themes

There are several ready-made themes in `Mafl`. But nothing prevents you from creating your own design themes and sharing them with other users
